## 1. Survey Structure and Categories

The survey is designed to be a practical and efficient tool for nonprofits, with a completion time of under 10 minutes. It is structured around **six core readiness categories** that are essential for successful AI adoption in the nonprofit sector. These categories are derived from academic research and industry best practices to ensure a comprehensive assessment.

### Core Assessment Categories:

1.  **Digital Infrastructure**: This category assesses the organization's existing technology stack, data management systems, and IT support, which are the foundational elements for any AI implementation.
2.  **Leadership & Culture**: This section evaluates the level of executive buy-in for AI, the organization's mindset toward innovation, and its readiness for change. Strong leadership is a critical driver of successful AI transformation.
3.  **Staff Capacity**: This category probes the technical skills, data literacy levels, and available training resources within the organization. A skilled and knowledgeable team is essential for implementing and sustaining AI initiatives.
4.  **Data Readiness**: This section examines the quality, availability, and governance of the organization's data. High-quality, accessible data is the lifeblood of any AI system.
5.  **Financial Resources**: This category assesses the organization's budget for technology, funding stability, and understanding of ROI. Financial readiness is crucial for supporting AI projects from pilot to full-scale implementation.
6.  **Use Case Clarity**: This section evaluates the organization's ability to identify specific problems that can be solved with AI and to define clear success metrics. A well-defined use case is a key predictor of project success.

## 2. Scoring Logic

The scoring system is designed to provide a clear, quantitative measure of a nonprofit's AI readiness. It uses a hybrid approach that combines a simple 5-level maturity model with a weighted scoring system to reflect the unique priorities of each organization.

### Score Calculation:

1.  **Category Score**: The score for each category is calculated as a percentage of the total possible points for that category.
    * `Category Score = (Sum of Question Points / Maximum Possible Points) * 100`
2.  **Overall Score**: The overall readiness score is a weighted average of the category scores. This allows for a nuanced assessment that can be adapted to the specific context of each nonprofit.
    * `Overall Score = Weighted Average of Category Scores`

### Readiness Levels:

The overall score is used to determine the nonprofit's readiness level, providing a clear and meaningful classification of their current state.

* **0-25: Foundational**: The organization needs to build basic digital infrastructure before considering AI adoption.
* **26-50: Emerging**: The organization is in the early stages of building its AI capabilities and has some foundational elements in place.
* **51-75: Ready**: The organization is well-prepared for AI adoption and has a solid foundation across most readiness categories.
* **76-100: Advanced**: The organization is optimized for AI transformation and is in a strong position to leverage AI for significant impact.
