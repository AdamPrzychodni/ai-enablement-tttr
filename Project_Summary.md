# Project Summary

## Task 1: AI Architect API

### Target Users
The intended users for this solution are nonprofit and social impact organizations that are looking to leverage AI to solve their operational challenges but may lack the in-house technical expertise to translate their needs into actionable projects.

### Ethical Considerations
The design of the AI Architect API addresses ethical considerations by emphasizing transparency and safety, particularly when dealing with sensitive domains like healthcare in developing countries. The system's knowledge base includes case studies that highlight the importance of a "human-in-the-loop" model to ensure clinical safety and build trust. Future recommendations for the API include implementing source attribution to show users the evidence behind a recommendation, further enhancing transparency and trust.

### Technical Approach
The AI Architect API is built using **FastAPI**, chosen for its high performance and automatic generation of API documentation. The solution uses the **OpenAI API** (specifically `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` for cost-effectiveness, with the option to upgrade to more powerful models) for its natural language understanding and generation capabilities. A key component of the technical approach is the two-step (`/analyze` and `/recommend`) pipeline, which separates problem understanding from solution generation. To ensure recommendations are relevant and practical for the nonprofit sector, a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system was implemented using `sentence-transformers` and `faiss` to ground the LLM's suggestions in a curated knowledge base of successful real-world nonprofit projects.

### Creative Features
Beyond the basic requirements, the following creative features were included:
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Instead of relying solely on the general knowledge of an LLM, the API uses a simple in-memory vector store to find relevant, successful nonprofit case studies and grounds its recommendations in those real-world examples. This makes the suggestions more practical and credible for the target users.
* **One-Liner End-to-End Test Command:** To improve the developer experience and simplify testing, a one-liner command using `curl` and `jq` was provided to chain the `/analyze` and `/recommend` calls, allowing for a complete end-to-end test of the API's workflow from a single command.

### AI-Assisted Development
The development of this solution was assisted by AI tools. This summary document was generated by a large language model, which analyzed the provided source code and documentation to extract and synthesize the required information.

## Task 2: AI Readiness Assessment Tool

### Target Users
The AI Readiness Assessment Tool is designed for nonprofit organizations of all sizes, particularly those at the beginning of their digital transformation journey who want to understand their preparedness for adopting AI technologies. The tool is designed to be accessible and valuable even for organizations with limited technical expertise.

### Ethical Considerations
The design of the assessment tool has considered the ethical implications of AI adoption in the nonprofit sector. The research and literature review for the project identified the need for an **Ethical Framework Integration** as a future enhancement. This would involve adding a dedicated module based on Responsible AI principles such as fairness, transparency, and accountability to assess not just technical readiness but also ethical preparedness, which is critical for maintaining community trust.

### Technical Approach
The AI Readiness Assessment Tool is a web application built with **Streamlit**, which was chosen for its ability to rapidly create interactive and user-friendly data applications with Python. The application guides users through a multi-page survey using the `streamlit_survey` library. The backend logic is modular, with separate Python modules for handling the survey questions (`survey_questions.py`), scoring (`scoring.py`), and generating recommendations (`recommendations.py`). For data processing and calculations, the tool uses **pandas** and **numpy**. An optional feature uses the **OpenAI API** to generate a narrative, human-readable report from the quantitative results.

### Creative Features
The following creative features were included to enhance the value of the tool for nonprofits:
* **LLM-Generated Narrative Report:** After receiving their quantitative scores and rule-based recommendations, users have the option to click a button to generate a detailed, narrative report. This feature sends the structured results to an LLM, which then writes a human-readable, encouraging, and actionable summary, making the results more accessible and easier to understand for a non-technical audience.
* **Downloadable Report:** The generated narrative report can be downloaded as a Markdown file, allowing users to easily share and reference their results within their organization.

### AI-Assisted Development
For the initial phases of understanding requirements and conducting the literature review, tools such as NotebookLM, Elicit, and a variety of large language models including Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT were instrumental in synthesizing information and accelerating research. During the development and documentation phases, coding assistants, CLIs, and copilots, alongside generative models like Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT, were used to write, debug, and document the codebase efficiently.
