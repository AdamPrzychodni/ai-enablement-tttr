## 3\. Technical Stack

The AI Architect API will be developed using a modern, efficient, and scalable tech stack:

  * **API Framework**: **FastAPI** is chosen for its high performance, ease of use, and automatic generation of interactive API documentation.
  * **Language Model**: The **OpenAI GPT-4 API** will be used for its advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities. A fallback mechanism will be included to handle potential API issues.
  * **Vector Store**: A simple vector store will be implemented for the initial version to quickly prototype and store curated knowledge, such as successful AI implementations in the humanitarian sector. This is inspired by the World Bank's ImpactAI project and will allow for more contextually relevant recommendations.

## 4\. API Endpoints

The API consists of two main endpoints, `/analyze` and `/recommend`.

### POST /analyze

  * **Purpose**: To take a vague, unstructured problem statement from a nonprofit and convert it into a structured, actionable format.
  * **Input**: A JSON object with a `problem_statement` string.
  * **Process**: The endpoint sends the `problem_statement` to the ChatGPT LLM with a specialized prompt designed to extract the core problem, summarize it, and generate clarifying questions if needed. This is based on research into implicit intent understanding to reduce unnecessary back-and-forth communication.
  * **Output**: A structured JSON object containing a unique `problem_id`, a concise `description` of the problem, and a list of `clarifying_questions`.

### POST /recommend

  * **Purpose**: To generate a tailored, actionable AI solution based on the structured problem from the `/analyze` endpoint.
  * **Input**: The exact JSON output from the `/analyze` endpoint.
  * **Process**: The structured problem description is sent to the ChatGPT LLM, along with context from the simple vector store. This allows the model to recommend a tech stack and initial steps that are relevant to the nonprofit sector.
  * **Output**: A JSON object containing a `solution_summary`, a `recommended_tech_stack`, and a list of actionable `initial_steps`.

## 5\. Data Structures

The data structures are designed to be simple, clear, and efficient, using Pydantic for data validation.

### /analyze Endpoint

#### Request

```python
class AnalyzeRequest(BaseModel):
    problem_statement: str
```

#### Response

```python
class AnalyzeResponse(BaseModel):
    problem_id: str
    description: str
    clarifying_questions: List[str]
```

### /recommend Endpoint

#### Request

```python
class RecommendRequest(BaseModel):
    problem_id: str
    description: str
    clarifying_questions: List[str]
```

#### Response

```python
class RecommendResponse(BaseModel):
    solution_summary: str
    recommended_tech_stack: List[str]
    initial_steps: List[str]
```

## 6\. Future Enhancements

While the initial version will provide a strong foundation, there are several opportunities for future enhancements:

  * **RAG Implementation**: The simple vector store can be upgraded to a more robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a dedicated vector database to provide more evidence-based recommendations.
  * **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents could be developed for different nonprofit domains (e.g., fundraising, operations) to provide more comprehensive and domain-specific solutions.
  * **Adaptive Learning**: The system could be enhanced to learn from user feedback, allowing it to adapt and improve its recommendations over time based on the organization's sector, size, and previous interactions.
